A data structure with a single root

root ==> starting node
leaf ==> node without children

BINARY TREES:
 Special type of tree where Each node has atmost 2 children

BINARY SEARCH TREE:
Special type of binary trees;
Best for trees;

from the root all the numbers smaller to it is located to root's left;
and every node to the right is greater than the root

BST's performance suffer when the tree is one sided hence balancing is needed

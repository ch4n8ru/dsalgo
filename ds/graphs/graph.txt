Collections of nodes and connections(vertices)

No entry or exit points and multiple paths to reach point a from b

Tree is a special type of graph where only one path exists between two nodes

Terminology

Vertex : refers to a node

Edge : connections between vertices

Directed graph: the edges have a direction (One way relationship)

Undirected graph:NO directions on the edge (Two way relationship)

Weighted : A value is assigned to each edge

Unweighted : No weights all edges are the same

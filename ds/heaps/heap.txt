In Max Binary heap:
The parent must be larger than the child

In Min Binary heap:
The parent must be smaller than the child

It has no relationship like BST ie(no ordering among siblings other than that they are smaller than the parent for Max Heap)

Relationship between the parent and child nodes

For any given parent node with index n its child nodes are index
        (2n+1) , (2n+2) 
For any given child with index n its parent is 
        floor((n-1)/2)
